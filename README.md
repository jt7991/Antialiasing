# Antialiasing
This project renders an image based on the equation 𝑓(𝑥, 𝑦) = 1/2(1 + sin(x^2y^2))). X and Y correspond to the location of each pixel. In order to render the function, use the panel and click "Draw Image." You can change the number of pixels with sliders. Click the button that says "Antialiasing" to enable antialiasing.
